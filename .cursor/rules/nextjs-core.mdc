# Next.js Core Development Rules

## Project Structure
- Use App Router (app directory) for new projects, not Pages Router
- Place components in `components/` directory with proper organization
- Use `lib/` for utilities, hooks, and shared logic
- Store types in `types/` directory
- Use `public/` for static assets

## File Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case for file and folder names
- Use PascalCase for React components
- Use camelCase for utilities and hooks
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants

## Component Guidelines
- Always use TypeScript for components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper prop types with interfaces
- Use React.FC or explicit return types
- Prefer composition over inheritance

## Performance Best Practices
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting
- Implement proper loading states
- Use React.memo() for expensive components
- Optimize images with next/image
- Use proper caching strategies

## State Management
- Use React state for local component state
- Use Context API for shared state
- Consider Zustand or Redux Toolkit for complex state
- Avoid prop drilling

## Error Handling
- Implement error boundaries
- Use try-catch for async operations
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately
